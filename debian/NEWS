redsocks (0.4+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  As of 0.4+dsfg-2, redsocks will look for /etc/redsocks.conf by default. Prior
  versions would look for $(pwd)/redsocks.conf. If you relied on this behavior,
  make sure to pass the appropriate config file location using the -c flag.

  Also beginning with 0.4+dfsg-2, redsocks is started by default upon
  installation. The START option is no longer available in
  /etc/default/redsocks, and system service management commands should be used
  instead (e.g. update-rc.d, systemctl).
