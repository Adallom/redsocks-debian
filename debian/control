Description: arbitrary TCP connection redirector to a SOCKS or HTTPS proxy server
 Redsocks is a daemon running on the local system, that will transparently
 tunnel any TCP connection via a remote SOCKS4, SOCKS5 or HTTP proxy server. It
 uses the system firewall's redirection facility to intercept TCP connections,
 thus the redirection is system-wide, with fine-grained control, and does 
 not depend on LD_PRELOAD libraries.
 .
 Redsocks supports tunneling TCP connections and UDP packets. It has
 authentication support for both, SOCKS and HTTP proxies.
 .
 Also included is a small DNS server returning answers with the "truncated" flag
 set for any UDP query, forcing the resolver to use TCP.
